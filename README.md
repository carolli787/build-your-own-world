# Build Your Own World Design Document
Carol Li, Tadeo Gardea 

## Project Overview
Build your own world creates an engine for generating explorable worlds. 

## Special Features
One feature my partner and I incorporated was "line of sight". By default, the lights are off and the user can only see tiles within a 5x5 square of them. The user can press the 'G' key to turn the lights back on and render the entire world. They can press 'G' again to turn the lights back off and so on. Furthermore, the tiles displayed are the ones near the avatar in a diamond shape. When the player presses l, the whole world is revealed. In the Heads Up Display, there is a place for the world to display date and time, and updating constantly. The player can see the time updating in seconds, as well as minutes and hour, and the day as well.
